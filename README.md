## Project Description

Our project represents a Pokemon game, where you can explore a 3D sky island. By going to specific locations on the map!, different actions become available like buying pokemons, or navigating on a map full of locations and choosing your pokemons to battle. On each location on the map, you'll encounter a pokemon which you have to defeat in order to acquire experience and coins, which can be used to buy stronger pokemons.
